Outline for Word Guess Game

Theme : PixelArt | 90's Action Movies

//This program receives single character input from the user
//and matches it to characters making up a predefined word
//selected at random from an array. If the user enters a matching
//character this character is displayed on the screen at the same
//index it would be in the word. User wins when they have guessed
//the word correctly and losses when they have used all their guesses.

//The game will respawn a new word after every game, win or loose.
